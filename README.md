### Early Lisp History Slides and Material

This repo contains the slides and article related to the Early Lisp History talk. I've used the [Early Lisp History](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=802047) by Herbert Stoyan as a starting point to then go read and collect many other documents which are available in the [related-paper](https://github.com/reborg/lisp-history-talk/blob/master/related-papers) folder. The original ACM paper is protected by copyright and was not uploaded, but all other papers are freely available on the Internet and collected here for easy consultation.

#### Content
