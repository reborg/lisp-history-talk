# Is there hope?

* Of course!
* Human beings are short lived
* Knowledge persists through books, media, etc.
* Humans forget, distort, make mistakes
* As a consequence, history repeats
* Learn the past to shape a better future

# What can I do?

* Tell the Lisp tale to friends and family
* Talk at conferences and meetups
* Write blogs, libraries, books
* Finally crack the "intelligence" problem
* Never stop learning!
