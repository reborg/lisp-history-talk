# What makes a language popular?

# About expressiveness

*People expect that operations in the language cost a small unit time. But this expectation is false for a sufficiently expressive language. <br/> <br/>When the primitives are at a sufficiently high level, there is enough wiggle room underneath to permit a choice of implementation strategies. Precisely because Lisp is so expressive, it can be very hard to write fast programs (though it is easy to write pretty ones)* <br/><br/>(Steele and Gabriel, Evolution of Lisp, 1983)

# Factors

* After the AI Winter, some Lisp companies survived, many others went out of business
* Other languages were on the rise taking mainly an OOP approach: Java (1995), C++ (1985)
* A few relevant Lisps continued to thrive in the research community
* Web oriented applications shifted the focus of programming in different directions than personal workstation
  * Lisp was mainframe oriented first, personal workstation later
  * Not sure it failed to adapt to the Internet, or it was slow compared to other languages, Perl CGI for instance, ROR later.
