* John McCarthy (1927-2011)
* Ph.D. mathematics from Princeton 1951
* Then assistant professor at Dartmouth, 1955
* Soon after researcher at MIT, 1956

# What is intelligence?

* Hot topic in the '50
* Shannon's first [chess program](https://vision.unipv.it/IA1/ProgrammingaComputerforPlayingChess.pdf) 1949
* Alan Turing's [Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238) 1950
* Reasoning automation with the [Logic Theorist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Theorist) 1955


# "Artificial Intelligence" study proposal

<img src="media/dartmouth-proposal.png" width="800">

# Goals

> The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. <br/> [...] It therefore seems to be desiderable to attempt to construct an artificial language which a computer can be programmed to use on problems and self-reference.

# Desired features

* Abstracted away from hardware constraints
* Not much larger than the sentence it describes
* Allowing representable logical rules
* Enabling symbolic computations (not just numbers)

# Reality check: programming in 1958

* Fortran: symbolic, arithmetic
* IPL: list based, low level
* F-LPL: Fortan-compiled for list processing
* Algol: McCarthy tried to influence unsuccessfully

## Too restrictive, in one way or another

# The perfect storm

* September 1958 funding was granted
* Creation of a new MIT AI Lab with the following
  * 2 rooms
  * 2 programmers, 6 students
  * 1 secretary, 1 typewriter
  * Some limited CPU time

# Reality check: IBM 704

# Early attempts

<img src="media/diff-no-lambda.png" width="600">

* APL-ish single liner
* Algol like, not homoiconic
* "K": a dummy var to iterate memory addresses

# Lambda to the rescue

<img src="media/diff-lambda.png" width="600">

* Inspiration coming from Church's [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)
* **Î»** now allow `maplist` to declare the meaning of "J"
* No mutation, `maplist` gets fresh elements from storage

## Still not very lispy!

# Turning point: s-expressions

* Challenge: demonstrate Turing completeness
* Proof: feed Lisp to another Lisp
* Alternative syntax required for easier "punching"
* Extend `apply` to receive Lisp forms as lists
* `eval` would need to interpret 6-7 special forms

# And then Steve Russel came around

* *Steve:* "Why don't we write this apply-eval down to assembly?"
* *McCarthy:* "ho, ho, you're confusing theory with practice... this `eval` is intended for reading not for computing."

# Lisp 1 was born

# Lesson Learned

* Well defined goals
* Baby steps, small increments, refined versions
* If the alternative doesn't work, make your own
* Constrained resources => more time to think
* Team interplay
* Ultimately, no fear!
