# Abstract

What happened in the basements of the AI lab at MIT in the late '50 is a truly inspiring story. Lisp is one of the oldest languages. Surprisingly, many concepts that we give for granted in functional programming today were there almost 60 years ago! When I started learning about functional programming with Clojure, I naturally got interested in Lisp as well, its relationship with AI and what lambda calculus has to do with it. Despite the long history of innovation in computer science, you might heard that "Lisp has failed". How can it be?

## Initial Thoughts

- This is the early Lisp history, can probably skip some of the details to add more material
- It could somehow link all the way up to Clojure, I have a bit of history in Beast from the standard library talk to connect
- In between I could go a bit through Maclist/Interlisp, other Lisps, AI winter, post-AI winter, where CL is still alive
- Then link back to Clojure, closing the presentation on today
- Technically this is a long timeline, from 1955 Dartmouth Proposal all the way up to 2022
- So 2022, it's 15 years of Clojure to Celebrate
- The before Clojure could also show the couple of attempt from Rich to bridge Java and CL ahead of inventing Clojure
  - Could show a working https://github.com/reborg/jscheme
  -
- Could show Clojure bootstrapping from the old boot.clj file in LispWorks
- Would be amazing to show the emulated LispMachine in Docker, citing as a pinnacle of Lisp history
