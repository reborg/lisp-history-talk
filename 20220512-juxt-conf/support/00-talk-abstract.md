# A Tale of Lisp

## Abstract

Lisp is one of the oldest languages and it has a long and fascinating story. It went from being popular and well funded to a period of relative abandonment. In more modern times we've seen a resurgence of functional languages, including the return of Lisp to the mainstream with Clojure. Surely this must be the time that functional takes over? In this talk we are going to learn from the past remembering the fascinating history of Lisp, drawing conclusions about the present and ultimately ask ourselves what makes a language popular.

## Initial Thoughts

- This is the early Lisp history, can probably skip some of the details to add more material
- It could somehow link all the way up to Clojure, I have a bit of history in Beast from the standard library talk to connect
- In between I could go a bit through Maclist/Interlisp, other Lisps, AI winter, post-AI winter, where CL is still alive
- Then link back to Clojure, closing the presentation on today
- Technically this is a long timeline, from 1955 Dartmouth Proposal all the way up to 2022
- So 2022, it's 15 years of Clojure to Celebrate
- The before Clojure could also show the couple of attempt from Rich to bridge Java and CL ahead of inventing Clojure
  - Could show a working https://github.com/reborg/jscheme
  -
- Could show Clojure bootstrapping from the old boot.clj file in LispWorks
- Would be amazing to show the emulated LispMachine in Docker, citing as a pinnacle of Lisp history
