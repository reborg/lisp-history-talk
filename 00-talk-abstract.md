### Invitation

What happened in the basements of the AI lab at MIT in the late '50 is truly inspiring and this paper is telling us that story. Herbert Stoyan spent many years researching those early days and even McCarthy is pointing at his work in his papers!

Lisp is one of the oldest languages out there. When I started learning about functional programming, I got interested in why Lisp languages are what they are today, what's the relationship with AI, what lambda calculus has to do with this, or why I kept hearing things like "Lisp has failed".

Surprisingly, many concepts that we give for granted in functional programming today were there almost 60 years ago!

The paper is quite accessible and a good start for the new season of PWL. Some Lisp sources will be presented but there is no need to have a deep knowledge of the language. An html version of the paper is available at

### ideas

* Show McCarthy reference to Stoyan work
* Show pics of the MIT lab at that time, pdp-1 where things developed, the keyboard and stuff like that. Give context.
* Mention the trashcan from where fragments were recovered
* Throw in an early lisp snippet and ask the audience to read through implying that is still possible to do it nowadays
* Slides with the register structure and how the first functions got their names
* Slide to describe evolution of maplist in relation to introduction of the lambda notation
